## Background

It has been two weeks since I've been hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard. My first major task was a research project on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s.

I have designed the tables to hold data in the CSVs, imported the CSVs into a SQL database, and answered questions about the data.

## 1. Data Engineering

## Bonus
This will be added at a later date, I suspect fake data!



## Epilogue
Evidence in hand, I marched into my boss's office and presented the visualization. With a sly grin, my boss thanked me for my work. On my way out of the office, I hear the words, "Search your ID number." My employee ID number is 499942....this is what I found!

Technique Leader should be paid more than this! Also when did I change my name? Lies! (All jokes)
